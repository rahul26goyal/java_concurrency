    /*
    You may wonder that each thread outputs exactly the value that it gets through the constructor although the variable threadLocal
is declared static. ThreadLocalâ€™s internal implementation makes sure that every time you call set() the given value is stored within
a memory region that only the current thread has access to. Hence when you call afterwards get() you retrieve the value you have
set before, despite the fact that in the meantime other threads may have called set().
